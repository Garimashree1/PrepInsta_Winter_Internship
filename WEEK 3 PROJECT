## Data Analysis Learnings

1. **Exploring the Dataset:**
   - Understand the dataset's structure, column names, and contents.
   - Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. **Setting Up Libraries:**
   - Configure Python with Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation.
   - Utilize platforms like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Consider additional libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

3. **Cleaning the Data:**
   - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
   - Manage duplicate records using `.drop_duplicates()`.
   - Implement checks for consistency and error rectification.

4. **Transforming the Data:**
   - Use Pandas and Numpy to reshape the dataset.
   - Explore feature engineering for new variables and data normalization.

5. **Addressing Outliers:**
   - Identify and handle outliers using visualizations.
   - Choose an approach (removal or transformation) based on impact.

6. **Validating the Data:**
   - Conduct statistical tests and visual assessments.
   - Cross-verify key variables with external sources for alignment.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Document each step with clear code comments in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Articulate the reasoning behind data manipulations.
   - Include visualizations and summary statistics.
